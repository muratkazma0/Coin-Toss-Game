# Coin Toss Game
 The "Coin Toss Game" is a simple Python program that simulates the classic coin toss activity. The program randomly selects either "Heads" or "Tails" and prompts the user to guess the outcome. After the user makes their guess, the program reveals the actual result, and the user discovers if they guessed correctly or not.
